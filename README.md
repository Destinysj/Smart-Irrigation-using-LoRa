# Smart-Irrigation-using-LoRa
To design a simple to operate and reliable, low powered, long range wireless device. 
Which will regulate water level in the field as per requirement.   
# Hardware Testing
To find a perfect microcontroller that is cheap and compatible with LoRa 1276 v1.2.
List of Microcontroller 
Arduino Nano 
Arduino Uno
ESP8266
Raspberry Pi
# LoRa with Nano
When LoRa is interfaced with arduino nano it faces power issue however LoRa is 
compatible as receiver with Nano but as trasmitter it is not.
# WHY
LoRa 1276 v2.0 demands : Rx - 10mA, Tx - 120mA
Arduno Nano supply to I/O pins 40mA max. 
Above two statement can justify.
# LoRa with Arduino Uno
LoRa is compatible with Arduino Uno as transceiver.
